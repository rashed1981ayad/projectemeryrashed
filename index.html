      <p>is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed
         by animals including humans. AI research has been defined as the field of study of intelligent
          agents, which refers to any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize
          its chance of achieving its goals.

          The term "artificial intelligence" had previously been used to describe machines that mimic and display
          "human" cognitive skills that are associated with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem-solving".
           This definition has since been rejected by major AI researchers who now describe AI in terms of rationality
            and acting rationally, which does not limit how intelligence can be articulated.</p></div>

        <li><h2>History :</h2><br>
          <p>
              Silver didrachma from Crete depicting Talos, an ancient mythical automaton with artificial intelligence
              Artificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,[17] and have been common
               in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R.[18] These characters and their fates
                raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.[19]

              The study of mechanical or "formal" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity.
               The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that
                a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical
                 deduction. This insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the Church–Turing thesis</p>

                 <li><h2>Goals :</h2><br>
                   <p>
                       The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist
                        of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have
                        received the most attention.</p>

                        <h3>Learning</h3>
                        <p>
                        Machine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception,[k] is the study of computer algorithms
                        that improve automatically through experience.
                          Unsupervised learning finds patterns in a stream of input. Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main
                           varieties: classification and numerical regression. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in—the program sees a number
                            of examples of things from several categories and will learn to classify new inputs. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes
                             the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. Both classifiers and regression learners



                                <h3>Social intelligence</h3>
                              <p>  Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood.
                                [87] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the
                                 emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction. However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception
                                  of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.</p>

                          </li>



                          <li><h2>Future | Superintelligence</h2><br>
                            <p>
                            A superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence, is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence
                            far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. Superintelligence may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence
                             possessed by such an agent.[182]
                             If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself.</p>
